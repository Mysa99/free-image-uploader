Since repl has some weird shit system


1. You create a folder, name it what you want for the image eg. img.skids.host/gay

2. So create a folder called gay, make a file called index.html in that folder and then you put in the meta *ONLY THE META*

Note if you dont know how to do the meta a prebuilt one is called metacopy.html in root directory

3. change the image link, restart the repl then boom!

4. You can make a new folder and repeat or just change the image in the meta already.
